Hello, my name is Gabriela Stefanova and I'm a student in Sliven, Bulgaria.
      Now I'm studying programming in the best school in this town. <br>
      Before months i had a course in SoftUni - Basics with C#.<br>
      That's the programming language that I am learning now. <br>
      Last year I also studied HTML and CSS. I am the president of the school student council.
       I have good leadership skills and experience in the field <br> of communication and relationships with people.</strong>






--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've worked with a variety of technologies, each offering their own unique challenges and opportunities for growth. 
      From the core trio of HTML, CSS, and C# to the specialized areas of Arduino and Unity, I immersed myself in the 
      dynamic world of coding and creation.
      HTML and CSS were my first experiences in web development, where I learned how to structure and style 
      digital content. These languages ​​laid the foundation for my understanding of front-end development, 
      teaching me the importance of clean, semantic markup and elegant design principles. <br> <br>
      As I delved deeper into the realm of web development, I choosed C# as my primary programming language. 
      With its versatility and robustness, C# became my tool of choice for building dynamic web applications and backend services.
      From crafting APIs to developing complex business logic, C# empowered me to bring my ideas to life with efficiency and precision.
      <br> <br>
      Canva have played a pivotal role, allowing me to express my creativity and design skills beyond the realm of code. From crafting sleek user interfaces to designing eye-catching promotional materials, Canva has empowered me to elevate my projects and communicate my ideas effectively to a broader audience.
      <br><br>
      In conclusion, my experience with programming languages like  C#, CSS, HTML, C++ and applications like 
      MitApp,  Arduino, Unity, GitHub, and Canva has been a exploration, discovery, and growth. Each tool 
      has shaped my skills and perspectives in unique ways, propelled me forward on my quest to innovate and 
      create in the ever-evolving world of technology.
